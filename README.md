Intro to the MERN-Stack
A technology stack, also called a solutions stack, is a group of development tools/services used to build an application.

For example, the LAMP-Stack is a mature technology stack that uses: Linux, Apache (web server), MySQL and PHP (web development programming language).

There are a few tech stacks that use MongoDB, Express & Node as their backend solutions. Then one of the following front-end solutions is added to the stack:

React which results in the MERN-Stack
Angular which results in the MEAN-Stack
Vue.js which results in the VENoM-Stack
The MERN-Stack is by far the most popular tech stack currently and will remain so into the foreseeable future.
